          The story begins on the banks of the Apolaga River, 
          with the meeting of two ñuhu (sacred beings), one red 
          and the other golden. Above this, we see a dialogue 
          between two deities, an wize old man and Quetzalcoatl, 
          the feathered-serpent deity who is mythicized to be the 
          ancestor of all Mesoamerican people.

          Quetzalcoatl carries another deity on his back, shown

          a growth of primordial corn.

          Here we see Quetzalcoatl creating music, singing to the
          sounds of him scraping a bone against a human skull. In front 
          of him, with tears in his eyes and holding in his hand two 
          mushrooms, is the god Xochipilli, the prince of flowers. 
          The tears may be a result of a trance-like state induced 
          by the ceremony. In the background, we see the two ñuhu who 
          started the story, accompanied by a nocturnal insect, which 
          suggests that the mushroom ceremony was carried out at night.

          a singing deity. From these items brought together, a kingdom
          is built. Facing them on the left are 7 deities holding

          A character painted black is thrown into a cave, to later

          Subsequently, (on a later page) the 6 deities from the 
          ritual appear without mushrooms. They seem changed; it 
          was believed that mushrooms could be a path to spiritual 
          growth or rebirth. Some are larger, others with new 
          clothes or additional ornaments. The story continues with 
          the birth of the sun on a pyramid of songs. When it rizes 
          to reach its zenith, it is represented as a powerful 
          warrior who throws powerful rays like arrows.

          The new sun has been born through a sacred ceremony 
          in which Quetzalcoatl brought the sacred mushrooms that 
          were consumed by eight of the most prolific deities. 
          The story ends on a note of duality: light and darkness, 
          night and day.
