        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In Mexico, even before the arrival of the Spaniards in the sixteenth
          century, mushrooms had an important ceremonial and sacred importance.
          In Mexican culture, mushrooms began being consumed around 13,000 years
          ago in the first groups of hunter-gatherers. By the 16th century, the
          knowledge of wild mushrooms was widespread, diverse, and extremely
          detailed. Over 5,000 common names are known for edible wild fungi in
          different Mexican languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story shown on this codex links to the conception of the first
          appearance of the sun and its relationship with mushrooms. It
          corresponds to the creation of the universe as we know it, and depicts
          rites of corn and pulque (a sacred beverage in Mesoamerica). This
          pictographic document was written on a long screen of danned deer hide
          treated with layers of stucco, a material that allowed the hide to be
          drawn on. It has 52 sheets of size approximately 22cm x 26cm painted
          on both sides.
